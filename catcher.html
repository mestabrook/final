				<p>The Catcher in the Rye might be my favorite book of all time. It reminds me of an episode of Seinfeld, in that there really is no plot. The story doesn't go anywhere, it's just a whole lot of the main character wandering around aimlessly. However, the book is hilarious, and I love the negativity of the main character.</p>
